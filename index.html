        <h1>CSS Checkup</h1>    
            <p>Make a new HTML& CSS page using: <code>class</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>margin</code> and or <code>padding</code>, <code>font</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>width</code> or <code>height</code>, <code>border</code> and anything else which comes to mind.</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div class = "general">
        <h2>class</h2>
            <p><code>class</code> refers to an element on an HTML page which has been used multiple times. In CSS, calling up class with its <strong>octothrope</strong> enables stylistic features to be set for all elements within that <i>class</i>. </p>
    </div>
<br />
    <div class = "general">
        <h2>id</h2>
            <p><code>id</code> refers to an element on an HTML page which has specific, unique styling attached to it. In CSS, calling up an <code>id</code> occurs with <strong>[.]</strong> in the CSS page, thereby allowing these specific changes to be given to that elment.  These even override <code>class</code>--and this paragraph is an instance of the <code>id</code> overriding the <code>class</code>. Notice this font is different than what is seen in the paragraphs preceding and following this one. </p>
    </div>
<br />
    <div class="padding">
        <h2>margin or padding</h2>
        <p><code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> refer to spaces between elements and between the content of an element and its border (even if that border isn't visible). <code>margin</code> creates space around an element, <strong>outside</strong> defined borders. <code>padding</code> creates space <strong>inside</strong> an element's defined borders. Both elements have been adjusted via CSS.</p>
    </div>
<br />
    <div class="general">
        <h2>font</h2>
            <p><code>font</code> and <code>font-family</code> describe the ways in which letters show up, and can be set to <font-style:bold >bold</font-style:bold> or other styling along with <code>font-size</code> in a direct way. <code>line-height></code>also gives the page designer pixel-level control over the visual elements of a text.</p>
    </div>
<br />

    <div class="background">
        <h2>background</h2>
            <p><code>background</code> refers to the color upon which other elements sit on a page as a whole as well as the color within a shape.</p> 
    </div>
<br />
    <div class="general">
        <h2>width or height</h2>
            <p><code>width</code> and <code>height</code> refer to the breadth taken up by an element, most often a 2D shape...often describing the...  </p>
    </div>
<br />
    <div class="border">
        <h2>border</h2>
            <p>A <code>border</code> visually encases an element. Example: if one imagines a square, the lines connected at 90â€¢ angles refer to the border. Borders can take on many styles. This page has a solid border close to the edge; this paragraph has a dashed one.</p>
